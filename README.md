To use any of the Font Awesome icons on your WordPress site you have two options:

###1. HTML Option

All code examples on the Font Awesome site apply: [http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/#code](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/#code)

**Examples**
Pencil icon `<i class="icon-pencil"></i>`
Phone icon `<i class="icon-phone"></i>`
Chevron left icon `<i class="icon-chevron-left"></i>`

###2. Shortcode Option

Don't want to worry about HTML tags?  You can use a shortcode in your posts, pages and even widgets to display a Font Awesome icon.

The shortcode to use is `[icon name=name-of-icon]`, where name=X is the class of the icon you would like to use.

**Examples**
Pencil icon `[icon name=icon-pencil]`
Phone icon `[icon name=icon-phone]`
Chevron left icon `[icon name=icon-chevron-left]`
